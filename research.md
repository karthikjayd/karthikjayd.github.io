## Research Interests

I am interested in the intersection of Physics, Mathematics, and Didactics. My research focuses on how these fields can be integrated to enhance understanding and teaching methodologies. Currently I am working on Quantum Optimization, particularly on Combinatorial Optimization problems and their applications in Quantum Computing.
