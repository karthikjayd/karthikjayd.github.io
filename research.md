## Research Interests

In the past I have worked on topics such as Computational Physics, Astrophysics and Statistical Mechanics. Currently I am working on Quantum Optimization, particularly on Combinatorial Optimization problems and their applications in Quantum Computing. 


**May 2024 – August 2025**  
**Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte Festkörperphysik (IAF)**  
Pursuing a master thesis on Classical and Quantum algorithms (QAOA) for _Combinatorial Optimization Problems_, under PD Dr. Thomas Wellens and Vanessa Dehn. I am working on the implementation of the (Linear Ramp QAOA)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08577] for various combinatorial optimization problems, including the Maximum Cut Problem, Market Split and some specific industrial problems under the (Kompetenzzentrum Quantum Computing Baden-Württemberg (KQCBW)[https://www.iaf.fraunhofer.de/de/forscher/quantensysteme/quantencomputing/KQCBW24.html] project. 

During this period, I presented at two conferences:
1. *Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG) Frühjahrstagung 2025* in Bonn, Germany, where I presented a talk titled _"Quantum Optimization using Linear Ramp QAOA"_ for the Portfolio Optimization problem.
2. *KQCBW Developer Conference 2025* at Fraunhofer IAF, Freiburg, Germany, where I presented a poster on _"Energy grid optimization as a Linear Ramp QAOA use case"_.

**August 2023 – March 2024**  
**Fraunhofer-Institut für Kurzzeit Dynamik, Ernst-Mach Institut (EMI)**  
Worked as a student research assistant (Hilfswissenschaftler or Hiwi) in the Risk Management and Structural Protection Department (_Abteilung Risikomanagement und Baulicher Schutz_). Assisted in developing a demonstrator for quantum-computing approaches to resilience analyses of network structures, under Dr. Christoph Brockt.

**May 16 – May 27 2022**  
**A.T.S.O.A. 2022, ARIES Nainital**  
Attended the ARIES Training School in Observational Astronomy 2022 ([more details](https://www.aries.res.in/atsoa2022/)), conducted by the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational sciencES (ARIES). Topics covered: telescopes, optical data-analysis techniques, star formation and evolution, and extra-galactic astronomy.

As part of this training school, I completed a project on _Data Reduction and Photometric Analysis of Blazars_. We analyzed image data of the MRK 501 blazar from the ARIES 1.3 m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) using a BVRI Johnson–Cousins filter. Photometry (aperture photometry) yielded the blazar’s apparent magnitude and light curves. Pre-processing (image cleaning) was done with IRAF and DAOPHOT.

**January 2021 – August 2021**  
**Topological Data Analysis & Comparison of Physical Parameters of Different Forms of Graphene**  
_J. Karthik, et al._ “Topological data analysis and Comparison of physical parameters of different forms of Graphene.” _Int. J. of Computational Materials Science and Surface Engineering_.

**Abstract:** Different crystallographic forms of graphene were investigated for their physical properties using reported experimental crystal-structure data and molecular-dynamics study. We find interesting changes in the values of certain physical parameters and three-dimensional spatial variations (Young’s, Linear and Shear moduli). The simulated strength of graphene in different forms was compared with experimental values to establish structure–property relations. Topological data analysis was carried out using a two-dimensional plot generated with Platon from CIF files of each graphene form.

Worked on this project from January to August 2021 under the guidance of Prof. R. Somashekar, University of Mysore.

**October 2020 – December 2020**  
**Project Experience**  
Learned basics of Molecular Dynamics simulations using LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) while working on the project _“Stable amorphous system using Kob-Andersen type binary Lennard-Jones mixture with a Yukawa potential.”_  
*This project could not be completed due to health issues during the period.*

**Summer Project (Astronomy)**  
**May 2020 – August 2020**  
Developed a pipeline to compute the ephemeris of any heliocentric object given three observations of the object. It involved principles of celestial mechanics and numerical analysis. This project was preceded by tutorials on basic astrophysics covering topics like photometric image reduction, exoplanets, and gravitational waves.

In this project, I learned celestial mechanics and intermediate Python programming. I mastered NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and AstroPy packages and became competent in collaborating via GitHub. Team communication was handled via Slack.
