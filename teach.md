## May 2021 – July 2022
### Scooper Pair, YouTube {#scooper-pair}
Owner and content creator for the YouTube channel [_Scooper Pair_](http://www.youtube.com/c/ScooperPair), where Kerala State Eligibility Test (SET) Physics problems are discussed. 

- Started as a project during the COVID-19 pandemic to help students prepare for the Kerala SET exam, the channel grew to over **2,300 subscribers**, with 65 videos, passing the threshold for YouTube monetization. The channel focused on solving previous years' SET Physics problems, providing detailed explanations and insights into the subject matter. 

- Our team of five educators started by rigorously analyzing the syllabus and question papers of the previous ten years, identifying key topics and frequently asked questions. We then created a structured plan to cover these topics through video tutorials, ensuring that students had access to high-quality educational content. 

- The channel also featured discussions on important concepts in physics, helping students build a strong foundation in the subject. We also occasionally released [Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tQpAdWGvjTw) (short videos) which served as quick revision tools for students, covering important concepts and problem-solving techniques in a concise format.

- Scooper Pair had an official community on [Telegram](https://t.me/ScooperPair) with over 300 members, where students could discuss problems, share resources, and seek help from each other. Currently the channel is inactive, but the content remains available for students to access and learn from, with the channel crossing 100,000 views.

- To help students prepare for the exams, we also released [mini-tests](https://drive.proton.me/urls/745HFEPWRR#QcIwV48VDJPO) in the same format as the original exam, where over 50 students participated for a live online test. These tests were designed to simulate the exam experience, helping students practice under timed conditions and improve their problem-solving skills. The platform [SpeedExam](https://www.speedexam.net/) was used to conduct these tests, which allowed to get specific analytics on the results and ranking of the participants.

I managed the channel, including organizing content, coordinating with other educators, and creating educational videos. I handled all the post-production work, including video editing (using [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/)), thumbnail design (using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)), and channel management in YouTube Studio.

- I led the promotion of the event through social media and other channels, which helped to attract a diverse group of participants. This event marked the first time RIEM hosted a techno-cultural convention, and also an event that was fully organized by the student body, setting a precedent for future events at the institute. 
- I also played a key role in raising funds for the event through sponsorships and donations, expanding the budget to over ₹50,000 (approximately €500) to support the various activities and initiatives during the event. Through optimized budget allocation, we were able to plan a wide range of activities and resources for the participants, including workshops, competitions, and exhibitions, enhancing the overall experience of the event.

**Event Highlights:**
- Prior to the event, our team organized a series of innovative promotional campaigns to generate interest and excitement among the student community. These campaigns included a flash mob, a DubSmash video competition (Dubsmash was one of the predessors of present-day TikTok), a tree-planting campaign and a selfie contest. 
- The main event consisted of talks from various experts in the field. The talks included general topics like "Learning Life Cycle using ICT", "The significance of Carbon Footprint" and "ICT in language learning", as well as tutorials and workshops on specific tools like LaTeX, H5P and Sozi.
- Additionally, during the event, we organized game stalls where participants could engage in fun activities and win prizes, further enhancing the overall experience of the event.
- The five-day main event concluded with a TED-style talk competition *"Speak Your Mind"*, an inter-college event that provided a platform for students to express their ideas and opinions on various topics. 

This event was a significant milestone in my organizational experience, showcasing my ability to lead and manage large-scale events effectively.
