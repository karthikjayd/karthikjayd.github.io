# Hello there!

<!-- > *In a time when misinformation spreads faster than facts, being a physicist feels less like a profession and more like a responsibility.* -->

I’ve just finished my M.Sc. in Physics at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, along with [a master’s thesis at Fraunhofer IAF](/research/#master-thesis). My journey began in Physics Education, but as I moved forward, I found myself wanting a deeper connection to the subject. I came to believe that to truly teach science, you need to experience it as a researcher first. That idea brought me back to the heart of the field.

We often hear that we’re living in the *“Age of Information,”* but these days it can just as easily feel like the age of *misinformation*. That’s why I see my role not only as a physicist by training, but also as someone who has a responsibility to help foster critical thinking and a scientific mindset in the next generation.

Looking ahead, I hope to keep building bridges between research and education. I hope to contribute towards making science not just something students learn, but something they genuinely experience and live.

I have recently migrated most of my programming-related projects to a new home on [GitHub](https://github.com/aQuetzalcoatlus). I named the repo "A Quetzalcoatlus" as a small nod to my childhood fascination with dinosaurs.
