# Welcome!

I am an M.Sc. Physics student at Albert-Ludwigs Universität Freiburg, currently delving into the fascinating world of Quantum Computing for my master thesis at Fraunhofer IAF. Here I work on Classical and Quantum Algorithms to solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems like MaxCut and Max3SAT.
​
I started my academic career with an M.Sc.Ed. degree. Teaching is one of my greatest passions. I enjoy conveying complex concepts in an engaging and accessible manner. I believe that innovative learning assessment techniques are important in helping learners understand concepts at a deeper level.

In addition to these, I bring strong technical skills in Python programming and a growing proficiency in German, currently at B1 level proficiency.
