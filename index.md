I am an M.Sc. Physics student at Albert-Ludwigs Universit√§t Freiburg, currently finishing my master thesis at Fraunhofer IAF. My interests include Quantum Computing, Computational Physics, and Science Education. I have a background in teaching Physics and Mathematics at the high school level, and I am passionate about making complex concepts accessible to a broader audience.
