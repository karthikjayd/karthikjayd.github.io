## Integrated M.Sc.Ed. in Physics, Regional Institute of Education Mysore (2015 - 2021) {#msc-ed}

I began my academic journey with an M.Sc.Ed. degree from the Regional Institute of Education Mysore, gaining valuable experience in teaching Physics and Mathematics at the high school level. This background has provided me with a solid foundation in educational methodologies and a deep understanding of how to effectively communicate complex concepts to a broader audience. Teaching is one of my greatest passions. I enjoy conveying complex concepts in an engaging and accessible manner. I believe that innovative learning assessment techniques are important in helping learners understand concepts at a deeper level.

The degree program is a combination of three degrees:
- B.Sc. in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics (PCM)
- B.Ed. in Physics and Mathematics
- M.Sc. in Physics

This program allowed me to explore Physics and Science Education while gaining practical experience in leadership and management through roles in the student council and extracurricular activities. A key highlight of my time at RIE Mysore was the coordination of a five-day inter-college technological convention called [Swatantra](/teach.md/#swatantra), which I organized from the inception to the execution. This experience honed my skills in event management, teamwork, and leadership, and taught me the importance of effective communication and collaboration in achieving common goals.

**FAQ:** *Why did I choose to pursue another master's degree in Physics after completing an M.Sc.Ed. in Physics?*

During my M.Sc.Ed. program, I often felt the need to delve deeper into modern physics research and its applications. The [curriculum at RIE Mysore](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GM5V9RQQ3G#ENDsGft5Pnja), provided practical teaching experience but lacked the depth I sought in modern physics. The degree is highly regarded in India for Science Education, with 80 courses in the curriculum and a strong emphasis on teaching methodologies. This breadth of courses, however, came at the cost of depth in any one area. These limitations led me to seek further education in Physics, which I found at Albert-Ludwigs Universit√§t Freiburg.

At Freiburg, I have been able to delve deeper into modern physics topics, particularly in Computational Physics and Quantum Information Theory. I attended the following courses as part of my M.Sc. program:
1. Advanced Quantum Mechanics
2. Advanced Atomic and Molecular Physics
3. Quantum Information Theory
4. Numerical Recipes in Physics
5. Experimental Astrophysics
6. Classical Complex Systems
7. Advanced Laboratory Course in Physics
8. Term Paper: **Auf welche Wahrheiten k√∂nnen wir bauen? Physik und Theologie im Gespr√§ch** (On which truths can we build? Physics and Theology in conversation) - This paper explored the intersection of physics and theology, discussing the topic of **Scientism** and critiques of it. I gave some anecdotal insights into a case study regarding the significance of Scientific Temper in the current Indian political landscape.

# Interests {#interests}

1. üë®üèæ‚Äçüè´ I have a keen interest in **didactics**, which I pursued through various roles in content creation, tutoring, and teaching. I have created educational content on YouTube, worked as a subject expert on online platforms, and taught physics at different levels. Recently, I came across the concept of **Spatial Repetition** in the context of learning and memory, which I find fascinating. Ever since I learned about it, I have integrated it into my learning ventures using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Recent projects like [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/) are great examples of how this concept can be applied to learning complex topics like Quantum Computing. In the future, I hope to set up similar projects to help others learn complex topics in Physics and Mathematics using this concept.

2. üîê Digital privacy and security are important to me. I use [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/) as an alternative to Google services, and I am an advocate for digital privacy. I believe that everyone should have the right to control their personal data and online presence. Another interesting project in this area is [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) which is a privacy and security focused mobile OS, which I use on my mobile phone.

3. üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª I am also interested in **open-source software** and its applications in education and research. I have used various open-source tools like [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) for video editing, [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for graphic design, and [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) for teaching mathematics. I believe that open-source software can play a significant role in making education more accessible and collaborative. The world of Linux is my `/home` and I love trying out different operating systems like Manjaro, Debian and Fedora.

4. üóíÔ∏è Organizing is like therapy for me. I enjoy organizing my life, my work, and my digital space. I use various tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for note-taking and organization and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for knowledge management. I like setting up systems that help me stay productive and focused on my goals, including meal planning, budgeting, and time management. I like writing Python snippets to do tasks like budgeting. 

5. üá©üá™ I am currently learning the German language. I have completed language courses up to B1 level and am now working towards B2. The process of learning a new language has been both challenging and rewarding, and I enjoy the opportunity to immerse myself in a new culture through language. It goes without saying that I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to learn German vocabulary and grammar, which has been a great help in retaining what I learn. I am always on the lookout for people to practice speaking with, so if you are a native German speaker or fluent in the language, feel free to reach out!

42. Being a huge fan of **science fiction** and **fantasy** genres, I get lost in the world of comic books and science fiction. Harry Potter, Star Wars, [Bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_(comics)) and [Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_(comics)) are some of my favorite franchises.
