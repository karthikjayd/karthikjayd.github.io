I am an M.Sc. Physics student at Albert-Ludwigs Universität Freiburg, currently finishing my master thesis at Fraunhofer IAF. My academic journey has been enriched by a diverse set of experiences that have shaped my approach to research and education.

# Education and Experience

## Integrated M.Sc.Ed. in Physics, Regional Institute of Education Mysore (2015 - 2021)

Starting my academic career with an M.Sc.Ed. degree from the Regional Institute of Education Mysore, I gained rich experience in teaching Physics and Mathematics at the high school level. This background has provided me with a solid foundation in educational methodologies and a deep understanding of how to effectively communicate complex concepts to a broader audience. Teaching is one of my greatest passions. I enjoy conveying complex concepts in an engaging and accessible manner. I believe that innovative learning assessment techniques are important in helping learners understand concepts at a deeper level.

The degree program is a combination of three degrees:
- B.Sc. in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics (PCM)
- B.Ed. in Physics and Mathematics
- M.Sc. in Physics

## M.Sc. in Physics, Albert-Ludwigs Universität Freiburg (2021 - Present)

During my M.Sc.Ed. program, I had felt at several points the strong need to understand modern physics research and its applications at a deeper level. The [curriculum at RIE Mysore](https://drive.proton.me/urls/GM5V9RQQ3G#ENDsGft5Pnja), while giving me the practical experience in teaching, did not provide the depth of knowledge I sought in modern physics. Additionally, the courses did not provide any potential to explore research methodologies or engage in hands-on research projects, directly in the curriculum. While the varied number of courses in the curriculum provided a broad understanding of various disciplines of Science and Science Education, this breadth came at the cost of depth in any one area. These limitations led me to seek further education in Physics, which I found at Albert-Ludwigs Universität Freiburg.

At Freiburg, I have been able to delve deeper into modern physics topics, particularly in Computational Physics and Quantum Information Theory. I attended the following courses as part of my M.Sc. program:
1. Advanced Quantum Mechanics
2. Advanced Atomic and Molecular Physics
3. Quantum Information Theory
4. Numerical Recipes in Physics
5. Experimental Astrophysics
6. Classical Complex Systems
7. Advanced Laboratory Course in Physics
8. Term Paper: **Auf welche Wahrheiten können wir bauen? Physik und Theologie im Gespräch** (On which truths can we build? Physics and Theology in conversation) - This paper explored the intersection of physics and theology, discussing the topic of **Scientism** and critiques of it. I gave some anecdotal insights into a case stugy regarding the significance of Scientific Temper in the current Indian political landscape.

# Other Interests

1. I have a keen interest in **didactics**, which I pursued through various roles in content creation, tutoring, and teaching. I have created educational content on YouTube, worked as a subject expert on online platforms, and taught physics at different levels. Recently, I came across the concept of **Spatial Repetition** in the context of learning and memory, which I find fascinating. Ever since I learned about it, I have integrated it into my learning ventures using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Recent projects like [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/) are great examples of how this concept can be applied to learning complex topics like Quantum Computing. In the future, I hope to set up similar projects to help others learn complex topics in Physics and Mathematics using this concept.

2. I am also interested in **open-source software** and its applications in education and research. I have used various open-source tools like [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) for video editing, [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for graphic design, and [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) for teaching mathematics. I believe that open-source software can play a significant role in making education more accessible and collaborative.

3. Digital privacy and security are important to me. I use [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/) as an alternative to Google services, and I am an advocate for digital privacy. I believe that everyone should have the right to control their personal data and online presence. Other interesting projects in this area include [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) which is a privacy and security focused mobile OS, which I use on my mobile phone.

4. Organizing is like therapy for me. I enjoy organizing my life, my work, and my digital space. I use various tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for note-taking and organization and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for knowledge management. I like setting up systems that help me stay productive and focused on my goals, including meal planning, budgeting, and time management. I like writing Python snippets to do tasks like budgeting.
