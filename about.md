I am an M.Sc. Physics student at Albert-Ludwigs Universität Freiburg, currently finishing my master thesis at Fraunhofer IAF. My academic journey has been enriched by a diverse set of experiences that have shaped my approach to research and education.
​
Starting my academic career with an M.Sc.Ed. degree from the Regional Institute of Education Mysore, I have rich experience in teaching Physics and Mathematics at the high school level. This background has provided me with a solid foundation in educational methodologies and a deep understanding of how to effectively communicate complex concepts to a broader audience. Teaching is one of my greatest passions. I enjoy conveying complex concepts in an engaging and accessible manner. I believe that innovative learning assessment techniques are important in helping learners understand concepts at a deeper level.

In addition to these, I bring strong technical skills in Python programming and a growing proficiency in German, currently at B1 level proficiency.
